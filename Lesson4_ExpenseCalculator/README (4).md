### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JavaScript allows for interactivity and improves the design, creates cookies, and validates forms of web pages. 
2. Java and JavaScript are not the same language. JavaScript is interpreted in the browser while Java is compiled and can be run as a stand alone application. 
3. Variables are used to store data in memory. To create variables you use the reserved keyword "var".
